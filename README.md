# Little a Map

Players can have little a mapâ€”if they've surveyed the area in-game. This tool
renders a composite of player-created map items with the goal of minimizing external
effects on survival gameplay.

Design goals:

- Preserve the feeling that the world is large and mysterious.
- Avoid introducing unearned navigational aids.
- Facilitate sharing of geographic knowledge between players, as a treat.

## Usage

Render a statically servable slippy map from a game save:

```console
$ little-a-map '/opt/mscs/worlds/example' '/var/www/html'
Searched 3913 level regions, 432 entity regions, and 5 players in 7.16s
Rendered 8258 tiles from 356 map items in 0.44s
```

Subsequent runs will re-render only changed tiles.
