# Little a Map

Players can have little a mapâ€”if they've surveyed the area in-game. This tool
renders a composite of existing map items with the goal of minimizing external
effects on survival gameplay.

Design goals:

- Preserve the feeling that the world is large and mysterious.
- Avoid introducing unearned navigational aids.
- Facilitate sharing of geographic knowledge between players, as a treat.

## Usage

Render a statically servable slippy map from a game save:

```console
$ little-a-map '/opt/mscs/worlds/example' '/var/www/html'
Searched 3731 regions and 5 players in 11.84s
Rendered 5698 tiles from 186 map items in 0.41s
```
